# SkimLit

The purpose of this notebook is to build an NLP model to make reading medical abstracts easier.

The paper we are replicating (the source of the dataset that we'll be using) is available here : https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.06071

If you want to find the ground truth for this notebook (with lots of diagrams and text annotations) see the GitHib: https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning/blob/main/09_SkimLit_nlp_milestone_project_2.ipynb
